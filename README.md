# Real-Estate CRM QA Demo

Hello!

This is a project for building a scratch saleforce environment for testing purposes.

I also wanted to take the chance to familiarize myself with Salesforce environment structure and tools like Data Loader, Data Import Wizard, SF CLI, and writing Playwright for some automated functional testing. 

Here is a video of me going through the project. The automation goes to the deals section and changes the status of the deal.
